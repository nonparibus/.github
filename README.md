## `.github`

This is my personal `.github` repo. It contains my `profile/README.md` and will come to contain any [community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) that make sense, including:

- Basic issue templates
- Standardized PR template
- Default contributions guide: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Default security terms: `SECURITY.md`
- Default code of conduct: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- Default support information in `SUPPORT.md`
